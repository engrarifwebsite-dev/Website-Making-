## In Progress
- (none)

## Pending (by phase)
- [ ] Power Grid: Leave, CPF Loan and Increment sections (Phase 8, remaining part)
- [ ] Tax (Phase 9)
- [ ] Zakat & Fitra (Phase 10)
- [ ] Prince Account (Phase 11)
- [ ] My Transactions (Phase 11)
- [ ] Emergency Documents (Phase 12)
- [ ] Islamic Corner (Phase 13)
- [ ] My Assets & Items (Phase 14)
- [ ] AI Assistant Hub (Phase 15)
- [ ] Settings (Phase 16)
- [ ] Automation and cross-module refinements (Phase 17)

## Known Follow-ups (small items found while reviewing the code)
- [ ] Show `getMonthlyHolidays()` data on the Home page; the server function exists but nothing calls it.
- [ ] Apply the `HijriAdjustment` setting on the Home page; it is seeded in Settings but not used yet.
- [ ] Sidebar footer still says "Version 1.0 · Phase 3"; update it.
- [ ] The Family Tree UI file is listed as `Page_FamilyTree.html` but `Index.html` includes `Partial_FamilyTree`; make sure the file name in Apps Script matches the include.
- [ ] Age Calculator: the date of birth of a saved card cannot be edited (by design); the hidden file input created for each add/edit modal is never removed (minor).
- [ ] Add the `EducationDocuments`, `AgeCards` and `FamilyMembers` (with ParentMemberID, SpouseMemberID) tabs to `Setup_PersonalInfo.gs`. `EducationDocuments` and `AgeCards` are created automatically on first use.
- [ ] Do not add a separate `Partial_AgeCalculator` include: the calculator already lives inside `Page_PersonalInfo.html` and a second one creates a duplicate tab.
- [ ] `Stylesheet_Global.html` still has the old `.app-footer*` rules (unused now); delete them when convenient.
- [ ] Decide whether `Server_Footer.gs` (`getFooterHadiths`) is still needed or should move to the Islamic Corner page (Phase 13).
- [ ] Suspicious-login detection in `logLoginActivity_` (planned for Phase 17).
- [ ] Budget: link entries to Banks (BankID) and update bank balances.
- [ ] Budget: sync Salary (Power Grid) into monthly Income using GlobalSyncID (Phase 17).
- [ ] Budget: carry the Ledger running balance across months.
- [ ] Add the SavingsGoals tab to `Setup_Budget.gs` (currently created on first use).
- [ ] Power Grid: sync the net salary into the Budget monthly Income using GlobalSyncID (Phase 17).
- [ ] Power Grid: add the `SalaryStatements` and `EmployeeInfo` tabs to `Setup_PowerGrid.gs` (currently created on first use).
- [ ] Power Grid: "মোট ভাতা" is calculated as total earnings minus basic salary; confirm this is the intended definition.
